# Gender-Voice-Recognization-

As part of my internship, I developed a web application to detect and configure the gender of a person based on their voice. This project involved creating a machine learning model that leverages popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully developed a web application to predict gender from voice input, showcasing practical implementation of machine learning techniques.
- Utilized Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
- Gained hands-on experience in integrating machine learning models into web applications, enhancing both my programming and analytical skills.
- Demonstrated the ability to work on complex problems and deliver effective solutions, further solidifying my proficiency in Python and machine learning.As part of my internship, I developed a web application to detect and configure the gender of a person based on their voice.
